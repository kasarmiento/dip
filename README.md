# DIP - Digital Image Processing
DIP stands for Digital Image Processing: Project for Graduate Level Course CS 555.

***Goals of Image Processing:***
* Improvement of pictoral info for human perception and interpretation
* Processing an image for storage, transmission, machine perception

***There are two types of resolutions to consider when it comes to DIP:***
1. spatial resolution (coordinate)
2. greyscale resolution (individual pixel values ranging fom 0 to 255 for 8-bit images)

***Assignment 1:***
* Find an appropriate image processing library that supports reading jpg
* Build a simple GUI to display images
* Create two filters to do the following:
  * take down an image to a lower resolution
  * bring the image back up to a higher resolution (interpolation)
